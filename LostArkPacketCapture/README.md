# Lost-Ark-Packet-Capture

Lost Ark Packet Capture is a modified version of LostArkLogger that creates a communication bridge between the application and a Node.js script.

Most of the work here is based on  [shalzuth / LostArkLogger](https://github.com/shalzuth/LostArkLogger) and [luke121 / LostArkLogger](https://github.com/Iuke121/LostArkLogger). I've just added the bridge functionality, changed some code and stuff...

Also, unlike the original project, Lost Ark Packet Capture targets Net 6.0.
